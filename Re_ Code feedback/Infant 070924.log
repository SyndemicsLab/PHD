231        If a record has one of these codes, it is 'flagged' for OUD.

234        record is flagged with OUD.

393        and should not be linked back to the PHD ID.
394        1. ED: Within the ED Dataset, we are interested in if `ED_DIAG1`
395           or `ED_PRINCIPLE_ECODE` are within our OUD Code list.
396           A temporary variable `OUD_ED_RAW` is created as a flag.
397        2. ED_DIAG: Within the ED_DIAG Dataset, we construct our flag,
398           `OUD_ED_DIAG` from the variable `ED_DIAG`
399        3. ED_PROC: Within the ED_PROC Dataset, we construct our flag,

428        `OO_PRINCIPALEXTERNAL_CAUSECODE`. We preform a rowwise search and

841           start date is < 7, we merge the two records together.
842        2. After this merge, if there are any more records which are <7 they
843           are removed from counts/starts tabulation
844        3. If medication A is found to be completely encompassed by another
